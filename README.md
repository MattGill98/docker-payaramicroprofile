This repository is for the **Payara Microprofile**. The image derived from this repository is hosted on Docker Hub.

* Payara Microprofile can be used in the same way as Payara Micro, and is located in the `/opt/payara41` directory. This is deliberately free of any versioning so that any scripts written to work with one version can be seamlessly migrated to the latest docker image.
* This is built on OpenJDK 8 images with an Alpine linux base to keep image size as small as possible.
